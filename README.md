# Welcome to my News Website Front End Project!

This is my first project developed during the JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders. It is built on and uses the backend API I created previously within this bootcamp and showcases a responsive, React based news website. Key features include:

- Accessible semantic HTML
- Reactive elements built according to user stories
- Reusable components
- Implemented React Router for dynamic URLs
- Loading state and optimistic rendering for enhanced UX

The back end of the project can be found using the following link: [News Website Backend](https://github.com/xsaynt/nc-news-backend).

The hosted site can be found using the following link: [Hosted News Website](https://alexp-nc-news.netlify.app)
