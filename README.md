Welcome to my News Front End Project!

This is my first project, developed during the JavaScript Software Development Bootcamp at Northcoders. It is built on and uses the backend API I created previously within this bootcamp and showcases a responsive, React based news website. Key features include:

Mobile-first responsive design
Accessible semantic HTML
Reactive elements built according to user stories
Organised file structure and reusable components
Use of TailwindCSS for a modern approach to styling
Implemented React Router more shareable and dynamic URLs
Loading state and optimistic rendering for enhanced UX

The back end of the project can be viewed here.

The hosted site can be viewed here.

(Please note that there may be a small spin-up period when first loading the site.)
